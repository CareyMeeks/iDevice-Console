# iDevice Console
This project was a handy UI I created to assist in debugging iOS applications.
This was super useful when I was developing jailbroken iOS tweaks, as it allowed isolation of processes and filtering lines that contained certain flags.

## Usage
This has been superseded by the new Console application present in later versions of macOS.
However, it *may* still have a bit of utility.
When I last developing for jailbroken iOS, macOS' Console app did not show all logs from applications running on my device, and the Console app was *very* noisy.
iDevice Console seemed to have the missing logs.
